# Python-Decision-Tree-Model
# Exercise 5.4: Intro to Data Mining

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook detailing the steps of initial data exploration and decision tree modeling as part of a data mining introduction. This project was undertaken as an educational exercise to apply data mining techniques on a dataset consisting of bank client data to predict customer churn.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to delve into data mining, focusing on understanding the process of decision tree creation and its application in predicting whether bank clients will leave based on their profiles. This exercise is part of a larger curriculum aimed at developing proficiency in handling ethical dilemmas in data analytics and enhancing predictive analysis skills.

## Repository Structure

- **Jupyter Notebook:** The main file `Exercise_5.4_Intro_to_Data_Mining.ipynb` includes comprehensive steps from data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, to modeling and predictions using a decision tree classifier.

## Key Objectives

- Understand and execute data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover underlying patterns.
- Develop a decision tree model to predict customer churn.
- Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance and interpret the results.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: For all data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Libraries used for data structures and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For generating visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Utilized for creating and evaluating the decision tree model.

## Decision Tree Insights

The decision tree created in this project helps in identifying the key factors influencing client decisions to leave the bank, providing insights that can potentially guide retention strategies.

## Visualizations

This project includes various charts and a detailed decision tree visualization which illustrate the relationships between client attributes and their churn status.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The findings and methodology from this exercise provide a foundational understanding of how decision tree models can be developed and tuned in a data mining context, offering a structured approach to predictive analytics.
